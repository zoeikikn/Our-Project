# Our-Project

We have a challenging idea. We need more friends to join us and turn this idea into reality.
What is our objective?
We aim to build a platform where people can discover the logical relationships behind things and start thinking proactively about the essential questions.
Why do we have this objective?
Today, many people focus on the most superficial phenomena and the immediate issues. As a result, they don't actively think about the essential questions. We noticed that people are constantly switching their focus when their attention can only stay on the surface of things. That is why they can't make sense of the logic behind things. Secondly, they pay attention to details but cannot integrate them to find things' essence. People think daily to solve the problems before them but hardly think about where they come from. At the same time, they believe that the large of information is rich and valuable. However, most people are not interested in information beyond their perceptions. They also have difficulty accepting views that are different from their values. This situation leads people to receive the same type of information in the same ways all the time. More importantly, today's Internet encourages this way of thinking. On the Internet, people are surrounded by much information that is repetitive and lacks logical relationships. Under the influence of this way of thinking, people become more narrow-minded and less tolerant. The division of society is also further increased.
What do we want to change?
We believe that finding the logic behind things and exploring the essence of things should be a way of thinking for everyone and not just a subject for experts. Therefore, we hope that everyone can get rid of the mass, superficial and fragmented information to think about the more essential issues and search for oneself.
We want to challenge this with you!
We know many people who never stop thinking about the status quo. They may have studied in some field in some depth. For example, philosophy, art, literature, physics, programming, astrology, economics, etc... But they seem to lack the opportunity to get together. We believe that cooperation and solidarity in different fields are the first steps towards change. Therefore, we welcome all those who are interested in our program. We do not discriminate based on age, colour, ability, national origin, race, religion, sex, or sexual orientation.
If you have the same ideas and are willing to start from scratch for this challenge, feel free to contact us.
We look forward to hearing your thoughts on these questions:
1.	how do you see the contemporary way of thinking?
2.	in your opinion, from what perspective and how can this way of thinking to be changed?
3.	what kind of collaboration do you expect, or what role do you want to play in the team?
We look forward to hearing from you: info@metaphysicsnothing.com
